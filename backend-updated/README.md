# Backend Integration for Route-Based Frontend

This updated backend codebase integrates seamlessly with the route-based frontend application, providing full support for application status tracking and cross-browser persistence.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. User Model Updates (`models/User.js`)
- Added `isApplicationCompleted` boolean field
- Added `applicationStatus` enum field ("In Review", "Accepted", "Confirmation Email Sent")
- Added `formData` object to store onboarding and application data
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing user data

### 2. Authentication Controller Updates (`controllers/authController.js`)
- Login and register responses now include `isApplicationCompleted` and `applicationStatus`
- Merges application data from Application model into user response
- Provides complete user profile data for frontend AuthContext initialization

### 3. User Controller Updates (`controllers/userController.js`)
- Enhanced `getUserProfile` to include application status and form data
- Added `markApplicationCompleted` function for application submission
- Added `updateApplicationStatus` function for admin status updates
- Added `updateUserFormData` function for onboarding step data persistence

### 4. Application Controller Updates (`controllers/applicationController.js`)
- Enhanced to sync application data with User model
- Added `submitApplication` function that marks application as completed
- Updates user status when application is submitted

### 5. New Routes (`routes/userRoutes.js`)
- `PUT /api/users/form-data` - Update user form data during onboarding
- `POST /api/users/:id/complete-application` - Mark application as completed
- `PUT /api/users/:id/application-status` - Update application status (admin)

### 6. Enhanced Application Routes (`routes/applicationRoutes.js`)
- `POST /api/applications/submit` - Submit application and mark as completed

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register new user
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login user

### User Management
- `GET /api/users/profile` - Get user profile with application status
- `PUT /api/users/profile` - Update user profile
- `PUT /api/users/form-data` - Update form data during onboarding
- `POST /api/users/:id/complete-application` - Mark application completed
- `PUT /api/users/:id/application-status` - Update application status

### Applications
- `GET /api/applications` - Get user's application
- `POST /api/applications` - Create/update application
- `POST /api/applications/submit` - Submit application (marks as completed)
- `GET /api/applications/all` - Get all applications (admin)

## Frontend Integration

### Updated API Service
The `frontend-api-service.js` file contains the updated API functions that match the new backend endpoints. Replace your frontend's `src/services/api.js` with this file.

### Key Integration Points

1. **Login/Register**: Now returns complete user profile with application status
2. **Form Data Persistence**: Onboarding steps can save data via `updateUserFormData`
3. **Application Submission**: Uses `submitApplication` to mark completion and set status
4. **Cross-Browser Persistence**: User status is fetched from backend on login

## Installation & Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**:
   Update your `.env` file with:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=development
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
   ```

3. **Start Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Database Migration

If you have existing users, you may need to run a migration to add the new fields:

```javascript
// Migration script (run once)
db.users.updateMany(
  {},
  {
    $set: {
      isApplicationCompleted: false,
      applicationStatus: null,
      formData: {}
    }
  }
)
```

## Testing the Integration

1. Start the backend server
2. Start the frontend application
3. Test the complete flow:
   - New user registration → onboarding → application → dashboard
   - Existing user login → direct to dashboard or application based on status
   - Cross-browser persistence by logging in from different browsers

## Application Status Flow

1. **User registers/logs in**: `isApplicationCompleted: false`, `applicationStatus: null`
2. **User completes application**: `isApplicationCompleted: true`, `applicationStatus: "In Review"`
3. **Admin updates status**: `applicationStatus` changes to "Accepted" or "Confirmation Email Sent"
4. **Frontend displays**: Appropriate status badge and message in dashboard

This backend now fully supports the route-based frontend with persistent application status tracking across devices and browsers.
